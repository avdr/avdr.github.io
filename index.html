<h1>Abhay Vardhan</h1>
<p>
I am an entrepreneur and hacker with deep experience in mobile apps, web, analytics, search and big data. I am the co-founder of <a href="http://blippy.com">Blippy</a>, a cool way to discover GIFs and share them with your friends.
</p><p>
I started my work life at Motorola in Illinois where I developed one of the first implementations of Bluetooth on mobile phones. I was always passionate about programming and software, so while working, I decided to pursue a PhD at the University of Illinois.
After my PhD, I chose a new challenge and moved to California to join Google. I worked in the web search team and got hands-on experience in ranking, search evaluation and analysis of large amounts of data.
</p><p>
I could not resist startups for too long. I joined <a href="http://bloomreach.com">BloomReach</a>, where, as the first hire, I helped build the core search relevance engine. The BloomReach experience was pivotal in my entrepreneurship journey and directly inspired me to start Blippy.
